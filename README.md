## COMSE 6998 Practical Deep Learning Systems Performance Final Project

# Human Activity Recognition Using Tactile Patterns
## Zijia Chen (zc2521), Bowen Chen (bc2916)

# Project Description:
- Using densely deployed flexible pressure sensors to estimate precise human movements.
- Built customized data pipeline and multiple lightweight ML/DL models to classify human actions given inputs from our flexible pressure sensors.
- Our pressure sensors can be deployed in large scale with relatively low cost.
- Our models are computational friendly to edge computing devices.
- Human movements that can be recognized:
  1. Good Posture
  2. Cross-Legged(Right)
  3. Cross-Legged(Left)
  4. Leaning Right
  5. Leaning Left
  6. Slouch
